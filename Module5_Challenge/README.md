# Assignment - Module 4

# Overview:
The purpose of this analysis is to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type (Urban, Suburban and rural) and summarizes how the data differs by city type for the year 2019 and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.


# Results: 
Below are the observations:
1. During winter time and at the start of the year higest fare was for Urban city type and it went on increasing till the start of summer (till May month)
2. Fare dropped for all the 3 city types in May 2019


## Summary: 
1. During winter people in Urban cities prefers more public transport hence the rides are less and thus fares are high (start of the year). Pyber can arrange more rides in the winter time in urban areas thus reducing the fare amount.
2. Fare in Rural city seems to be pretty stable till May 2019 which shows that Rural cities have more rides available than prople living there uses.
3. At the start of May month (at the start of summer) people in all 3 city types stopped using rides considerably hence there is a dip in the fare prices after May 2019
